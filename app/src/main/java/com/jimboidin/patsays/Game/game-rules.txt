    PAT SAYS GAME EXPLANATION
    ---------------------------

    Pat Says is a simple card game where the object of the game is to be the first player with no
    cards remaining (in their hand or on the table).

    Players begin with 9 cards:
        > 3 face-down on table (the player does not know what these cards are)
        > 3 face-up on table (the player chooses these at the beginning of game)
        > 3 in their hand.

    The remaining cards of the deck, are face-down on the table in the 'leftover pile'

    Players take turns playing a card. The card played must be higher than the card previously
    played (in the 'play pile') *See card value explanation below*
    While there are still cards remaining in the leftover pile, players must pick up a single card
    from it every time they play a card.
    NOTE: It is possible to play multiple cards of the same value, if so, the player still only
    needs to pickup a single card from the leftover pile.

    If a player is unable to play a card (ie. they have no card of higher value, then they must
    pickup the entire play pile.

    When a player wins the game (has no more cards), the game continues with the remaining players
    until only one person has cards left and then it ends.

    The value of cards is numeric (ie a 6 is higher than a 4) Suit is irrelevant.
    There are special cards, some of which can be played at any time.
    Ace is the highest non-special card

    Special Cards:
    --------------
        (2) -- Reset. Value of play pile set to 0. Can be played at any time
        (3) -- Invisible. Play pile value remains same as previous card. Can be played at any time
        (7) -- Reverse. Next play must be lower than 7. *Cannot be played at any time*
        (8) -- Skip. Skips next player. *Cannot be played at any time*
        (10) -- Burn play pile and go again. Can be played at any time
        (Joker) -- Choose a player to pickup all play pile cards. The turn also switches to that player

    RULES OF NOTE:
    > Multiple cards can be played at once (ie. 5,5,5)
    > Calling 4 [Value] burns deck and lets player go again
        for example, if a player has four 6s they can play all and it acts like a 10 card
        also, a player could have 2 6s and know there are 2 6s already played, and call this too.
    > If a player calls 4 and is incorrect, they must pickup entire play pile.
