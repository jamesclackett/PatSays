# Pat Says 
---

Pat Says in an online-based 2-4 player card game build for Android devices. It is based off of a game known by many other names (Triple Jeep Jump for example). 
However it has now become known to myself and friends as 'Pat Says'. This is a nod to a friend who, in his wisdom has become the de-facto referee of our games.

The rules of the game are fairly simple. The first person to empty their hand and the table of all cards, wins. Cards may be placed on others so long as they are 'higher', and special cards
change the folow of the game or allow special moves to be played. Cards are distributed evenly among players. Of those cards, 3 are unknown and placed face-down, 3 are selected
by the player and placed face-up. The remainder are kept in their hand.

Players must first empty their hand of cards, then the 3 face-up cards (in any order), and finally the 3 face-down cards (also in any order).

#### Rules:

* Played cards are placed on the table on top of previously played cards.
* The played cards can sometimes be 'burned' and removed from the game entirely (see below)
* Suit/Color do not matter
* Multiple cards may be played at the same time (e.g three 7's)
* If the player is unable to make a play, then they must pick up all the 'played' cards

#### Card Values (In Ascending Order):

* 4

* 7 (reverses order for one turn only. i.e. the next card played must be lower than 7)

Special Cards (can be played at any time, all are equal value)
